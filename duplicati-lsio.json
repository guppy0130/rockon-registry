To do so, simply open its settings (little wrench icon), then click on 'Add Storage' and add any share you would like to backup. See <a href='http://rockstor.com/docs/docker-based-rock-ons/overview.html#add-storage' target='_blank'>Rockstor documentation</a> for instructions.</p><h4>Migration from older rock-on</h4><p>If you were using our previous Duplicati rock-on, it is possible to migrate all backups setup to this new rock-on.<ul><li>1. Make sure to install this rock-on using the same share for config; all backups that were previously set will be automatically detected</li><li>2. Update the database path for each backup. Expand the 'Advanced' section for the given backup, and update the path by replacing <code>/root/.config/Duplicati</code> with <code>/config</code>.</li></ul></p><h4>Rock-on update</h4><p>While Duplicati can be updated from within its own UI, it is <strong>not</strong> recommended to do so in order to prevent any conflict upon re-installation. Instead, it is recommended to uninstall the rock-on, and re-install it using the same shares (no data will be lost).</p>",
